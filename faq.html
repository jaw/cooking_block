    <h3>Why a commercial kitchen?</h3>
    <p>In order to legally make food for sale or resale in the state of California, it must be entirely prepared in a Health Department approved facility. There are strict requirements and a host of laws and regulations that must be met.   Cooking Block is supporting small business by providing a facility that complies with all of these requirements and provides professional grade equipment to work with.</p>
    <h3>How does Kitchen Rental work?</h3>
    <p>We have four separate kitchens for hourly rental. Each kitchen is health Department Certified. Each kitchen is equipped with 14' cook lines with burners, griddles, gills, stock pot ranges, fryers and convection ovens and 2 compartment vegetable washing sink. When you reserve a kitchen, that kitchen is exclusively yours for the entire reservation time. Of course our 14' x 14' walk-in cooler and professional dish washing room are shared portions of the facility. Cooking Block is creating a community for food professionals and artisans and an environment for them to flourish in.  Become part of this community and start making valuable connections.</p>
